# SpecGrav👓🌌⭐ - Curiosity for Gravitational Waves

## Abbrevations used:

BBH - Binary Black Hole

BNS - Binary Neutron Star

## Overview
In this project, I classify BBH merger signals, BNS merger signals and Noise using their spectrograms.
I generated BBH and BNS gravitational wave signals embedded in noise and created their spectrograms. I also generated random noise.

Convolutional Neural Network is used and it's structure can be found [here](https://github.com/HrithikaDodia/SpecGrav/blob/master/hrithika_model.py) 
and trained it [here](https://github.com/HrithikaDodia/SpecGrav/blob/master/train.ipynb).
